#When I used the make file provided under Lab/Lab3, there is a problem for compile failure, and I work this out below:

#1. Rename the "makefile1" to "makefile"  (the makefile under lab/lab3 is named makefile0 which is against the rule of make)
#I attached my whole makefile here, if the makefile can not work, please rename this file 'makefile' and run it.

#I also add an additional function for scence rotation, so it will be easy to look around this scence.  Just press 'r' to start or stop.
